Flies Fly
=========

Video game adapted from the traditional game "Pigeon Vole".

CULTURE
-------

This is a traditional game played at kindergarten level,
known as ["Pigeon vole"][REF_FR] in France and
["Alles, was Federn hat, fliegt"][REF_DE1]
or ["Alle Vögel fliegen hoch"][REF_DE2] in Germany.

The teacher gives names of animals or objects, uttering a sentence in a
fixed structure which states that the animal or object flies.
The role of the teacher can also be played at home by a parent
or an older sibling.

In the French version, the children must raise their hand, with the
forefinger lifted, each time the animal or object actually flies.
They start the game with the arm lowered and the forefinger touching
the table in front of them.

The teacher starts with "Pigeon vole" and raises her hand, then goes on
in the same way with different subjects: "Canard vole", "Avion vole",
"Papillon vole", "Eléphant vole"... The children raise their hand after
each sentence, following the gesture of the teacher in rhythm. The game
requires children to develop a strong will to refrain from lifting their
hand after the last sentence (since elephants obviously don't fly), breaking
from the behavior of the teacher and probably most of the group, trained
to produce an automatic response to the teacher's utterance.

The German version presents the following differences: the teacher starts
the game with "Alle Vögel fliegen hoch", the structure of the German sentence
is "Alle <subject> fliegen hoch", and raises both arms high in the air.
Likewise, children must raise both arms when the animal or object flies,
or keep both hands down with their forefingers touching the table in front
of them otherwise.

RULES
-----

* the game requires two or more players
* the first player plays the role of the teacher, other players are children.
* the game is played in multiple rounds
* at the start of each round, the teacher affirms that an animal or object
  flies, and raises one, or depending on the version, two hands.
* if the animal or object does fly, children must raise their hands
  in the same way. If not, they must keep theirs hands down.
* at the end of the round, children who raised their hand while the animal
  or object does not fly, or who did not raise their hands while the animal
  or object does fly, are eliminated from the game, or depending on the
  version, give a token back or pay a fine.
* the game can go on until only the teacher remains.

PLAY
----

In this computer version, the computer plays the role of the teacher
while the human player must react to the sentences presented by the computer.

The player starts the game by pressing the space bar, and keeping it pressed.
After each sentence that she agrees with, the player must release the space bar
and she is free to raise her hand high in the air, if it does not feel too
awkward. The game ends when the player releases the space bar after a false
utterance, or fails to release it within a short time after a true utterance.
